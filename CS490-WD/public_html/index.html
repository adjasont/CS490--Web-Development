        <h4>LeBron sets tone at Cavs media day</h4>
        <p>September 27, 2014</p>
        <p>
            INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- The satellite trucks started lining up for a
            spot close to the Cleveland Cavaliers' training facility early Friday morning. A huge tent was
            erected onsite as a temporary media workroom to accommodate the hundreds of reporters on
            hand for LeBron James' official return to the Cavs. He never did have a news conference this
            summer, if you remember. So whatever party the city of Cleveland was going to throw to
            celebrate the return of its prodigal son had to be Friday.
