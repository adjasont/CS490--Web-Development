                    INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- The satellite trucks started lining up for a
                    spot close to the Cleveland Cavaliers' training facility early Friday morning. A huge tent was
                    erected onsite as a temporary media workroom to accommodate the hundreds of reporters on
                    hand for LeBron James' official return to the Cavs. He never did have a news conference this
                    summer, if you remember. So whatever party the city of Cleveland was going to throw to
                    celebrate the return of its prodigal son had to be Friday.
